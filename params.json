{"name":"Flip","tagline":"Create awesome looking 3D view transition in your android applications.","body":"##Flip 3D View Animation and Transition\r\n\r\nThe view transition animations in Android are very limited. One particular omission is the 3D flip transition that is common in iOS. This project contains a animation subclass that allows for a 3D flip animation and a library that takes a `ViewAnimator` (such as `ViewFlipper`) and animates a flip transition b/n its subviews (left-to-right or right-to-left).\r\n\r\nThe key missing ingredient from most flip animation is the zoom effect. Without it, simple flips on the y-axis appear very much 2D and lose their distinctive 3D feel.\r\n\r\nTake a look at [this video](http://youtu.be/52mXHqX9f3Y) to see how this looks.\r\n\r\nThere are also a number of other animations in the `AnimationFactory` class. Enjoy.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52mXHqX9f3Y\r\n\r\n###How to Install\r\nGet a copy of the source [here](https://code.google.com/p/android-3d-flip-view-transition/source/checkout). Copy-paste the /src/com folder to your project's source folder. Use the flip transition in any of your `ViewAnimator` (such as `ViewFipper`) by doing:\r\n```\r\nAnimationFactory.flipTransition(viewFlipper, FlipDirection.LEFT_RIGHT);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's that easy!\r\n\r\nIf you want to create a `FlipAnimation` and use it some other way, you may do so by the constructor or the `AnimationFactory.flipAnimation` method.\r\n\r\n###Disclaimer\r\n\r\nYou may use, modify, etc. this code.
